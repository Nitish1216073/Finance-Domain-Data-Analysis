### **Roadmap for Data Analysis in Power BI**

#### **1. Define Objectives and Metrics**
   - **Objective:** Analyze loan performance and borrower characteristics to identify risk and trends.
   - **Key Metrics:**
     - Loan default rates by grade, purpose, and state.
     - Impact of income, employment, and homeownership on loan status.
     - Average interest rates, loan amounts, and installments by loan type.
     - Correlation between annual income, DTI (debt-to-income ratio), and default risk.
     - Credit and payment history trends (e.g., last credit pull date vs. loan status).
     
#### **2. Data Understanding and Cleaning**
   - **Load Data:** Import the dataset with the provided columns into Power BI.
   - **Check for Data Quality Issues:**
     - Missing values: Inspect columns like `emp_length`, `next_payment_date`, and `loan_status` for missing or incomplete data.
     - Data types: Ensure that columns like `issue_date`, `loan_amount`, `interest_rate`, and `annual_income` have the correct data types.
   - **Transformations:**
     - Date conversion: Convert date fields (`issue_date`, `last_payment_date`, etc.) to appropriate date types.
     - Text cleaning: Standardize values for categorical columns like `home_ownership`, `application_type`, `grade`, etc.
     - Handle missing data through appropriate imputation or exclusion strategies.

#### **3. Data Exploration and Modeling**
   - **Relationships and Correlations:**
     - Establish relationships between tables if there are multiple data sources (e.g., linking `loan_id` with `member_id`).
     - Use Power BIâ€™s modeling capabilities to create calculated columns, such as `total_payment` or `interest_paid` over time.
   - **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
     - Visualize loan status distribution (current, fully paid, charged-off).
     - Analyze loans by `grade` and `sub_grade`, examining their influence on default rates.
     - Examine how `annual_income`, `dti`, and `installment` correlate with loan default risk.

#### **4. Create Visualizations**
   - **Key Dashboards:**
     1. **Loan Performance Overview:**
        - Display total loans, default rates, and outstanding loan amounts using cards and bar charts.
     2. **Borrower Profiles:**
        - Use pie charts or histograms to show `home_ownership`, `emp_length`, `annual_income` distributions.
        - Display top purposes for loans and their performance (e.g., default rates by `purpose`).
     3. **Loan Segmentation by State and Risk:**
        - Use a map to visualize loan distribution and risk by `address_state`.
        - Show trends of `interest_rate` and `loan_amount` by state or grade.
     4. **Credit and Payment History:**
        - Line chart comparing `issue_date` and `last_payment_date` trends.
        - Heatmap or clustered bar charts showing payment behavior over time.
        
   - **Interactive Visuals:**
     - Include slicers for filtering data by `grade`, `loan_status`, `purpose`, and `term`.
     - Use drill-downs to analyze by sub-groups (e.g., filter by `application_type` or `home_ownership`).

#### **5. Insight Generation**
   - **Risk Analysis:**
     - Identify high-risk segments using factors like high DTI, low `grade`, short `emp_length`, etc.
   - **Performance Insights:**
     - Highlight trends in loan amounts, installments, and interest rates across different time periods (`issue_date`, `next_payment_date`).
   - **Borrower Trends:**
     - Explore borrower characteristics (e.g., `annual_income`, `emp_title`, `home_ownership`) affecting loan performance.

#### **6. Final Reporting and Presentation**
   - **Compile Dashboard:**
     - Organize key visuals into a concise dashboard for stakeholders.
     - Provide narrative insights and recommendations based on the analysis (e.g., suggest strategies to mitigate risk for certain borrower profiles).
   - **Export Reports:**
     - Export the dashboard as a PDF or PowerPoint for sharing.
     - Enable interactive sharing using Power BI online service.
